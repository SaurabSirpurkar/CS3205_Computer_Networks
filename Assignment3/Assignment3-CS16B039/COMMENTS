			ASSIGNMENT 3

******************************************************************

The assignment gives us the depth of implementation present in FTP 
protocol. We learn how to use the underlying TCP for safe data transfer
and to link application to the socket communication (binding) involved.
This shows us why the current day network applications are easy to write
as we do not have to worry about the lower layers. Even encode the data
(utf-8 or data64) there are ready APIs available between application and
the socket interface like the .encode() method that we have used.

Also we have divided the client into two encapsulated modules :
USER INPUT INTERFACE -  Deals only with the user input, parses it and sends 
			to network interface

NETWORK INTERFACE -     Takes in data given be UII, sends appropropriate 
			commands to server and saves files, shows stdout info
			as needed

We also learn the use of sockets and their behaviour, accuracy and speed
as we use them throughout this assignment.  

We also learn the usage of wireshark. By inspecting the packet and its
headers of multile layers, we gain a idea on how the encapsulation is 
done layerwise and the protocols, parameters involved in the same. 

This is the first time I have communicated files between two distinct 
systems without using the internet and in the process learnt a lot about
the network details and socket programming involved.
