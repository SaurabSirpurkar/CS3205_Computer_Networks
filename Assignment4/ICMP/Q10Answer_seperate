Question 10:

In the image of running traceroute in terminal (above Q5),
 we find that there is a sudden jump in the RTTs from router
 9 to router 10. This gap corresponds to a trans-continental 
link between these routers. As the domain we are interested 
in is vt.edu which is Virginia Tech University, this link 
here might correspond to on of the multiple trans-continental
 links from Asia. Similarly we can see few other jumps (15,16)
 (17,18). Each of these could correspond to subseqent trans-continental
 links or heavily conjested routers along the way.
