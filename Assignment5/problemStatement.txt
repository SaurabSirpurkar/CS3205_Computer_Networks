This is to enable you to get an understanding of the Internet routing protocols - RIP (Routing Information Protocol) and OSPF (Open Shortest First Protocol).

You are requested to create two topologies.

1) topology 1, is to be configured with RIP. The topology has 5 routers.

2) topology 2, is to be configured with OSPF, supporting two areas, has 5 routers.

The 5 pages that contains details are attached.

The demo and instruction in the class should be of help.

The information is shared as 5 pictures, size being large, shared via google drive

NOTE:

a) This is a group assignment. Max of 3 students can form a group.

b) Place the screen shots, and provide a sentence or two, caption, as what the screen shot means. just a dump and expecting to figure out will be challenging.

c) For the OSPF part, please provide output for the command "show ip ospf neighbor" as well.

d) In case the file size is large for submission, place it in a google drive, and share the link. Send email after you have made the submission for reference. Copy TAs Abin Mathew (CS16S038), Himanshu Kushwaha (CS17S010), Saashank (CS17S025), Vijay (CS18D018), sriharsha (CS17D012)

e) The hard deadline is 2 PM on May 12 2019. No extension requests. Earlier submission is much appreciated.

If you have spent time enabling GNS3, and got a working router, the total effort on this assignment is estimated atmost max 4 hours.
