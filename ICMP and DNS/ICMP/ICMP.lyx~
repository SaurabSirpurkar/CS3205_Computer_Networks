\begin_layout Standard
The ICM protocol, simply called ICMP, is one of the three main components
 of the Network layer.
 This is used by hosts and routers to specify the network-layer information
 to each other.
 The most notable feature about the ICMP is that these messages are carried
 as payloads inside IP datagrams.
 However, this does not mean that ICMP is an upper layer protocol.
 Interestingly, the traceroute programs extensively uses ICMP messages to
 get the IP addresses and RTT corresponding to the routers in a given path.

Using PING:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ping is a program that allows us to verify if a host is live or not.
 Ping makes use of ICMP packets.
 A 
\series bold
particular type of ICMP packet
\series default
 is sent to the interested destination.
 The host at the destination responds back with another typical ICMP packet.
 Using this packet, the ping program finds out RTT and status of the destination
 server.

Question 2:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the ping pakcets, we can see that the ICMP payload has not mention to
 any kind of address.
 
\series bold
ICMP is carried as a payload within an IP datagram
\series default
 and does not have an header associated with it.
 Within this payload, there is no mention about any address.
 This is not similar to TCP/UDP (have port addresses) which too are data
 carried inside IP datagrams.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This is because, when the protocol in IP header is ICMP the host/router
 has 
\series bold
well defined
\series default
 way of handling this ICMP data message.
 There is no ambiguity as to which single application needs to collect this
 information.
 Therefore there is no need of address inside ICMP message.
 The IP address of the destination in the IP header is enough for the packet
 to be tramsitted appropriately, unlike TCP/UDP where port numbers are needed.

Using TRACEROUTE:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traceroute is a program that makes use of UDP packets to get the IPs of
 all the routers along a given path and the time delays between them.
 This is achieved by sending a 
\series bold
sequence of UDP packets
\series default
 with TTL ranging from 1 to 64 (MAX).
 Everytime a router identifies that a packet has expired, it sends a correspondi
ng 
\series bold
ICMP error message
\series default
 to the source host.
 The traceroute then identifies the details about the router from this ICMP
 message.

Question 5:

IP address of our host : 192.168.0.101

IP address of Virginia Tech host : 198.82.215.14
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The destination IP address can be seen from the last echo.
 Alternatively this can also be seen from any echo because, every response
 (TTL expire warning) also contains the original packet the host tried to
 send.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Question 6:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Different upper layer protocols are assigned different values for the protocol
 field in the IP header.
 For ICMP it is 01, where as for UDP it 
\series bold
will be 17
\series default
.
 This is a must because, if the IP datagrams encapsulate UDP packets, then
 having 17 as the protocol number is important in processing the packet
 when it arrives at the host.
 If it were falsely written as 1 instead, the host will try to break the
 payload as an ICMP packet which
\series bold
 has different fields
\series default
 and demarcations.
 The same can be seen from the UDP probes sent from our Linux system.

Question 7:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ICMP packet resembles ping (request and reply) packet upto the IP header.
 From IP header, the whole payload is a lot different.
 This is because, the fields in the ping response (identification, sequence
 number) are absent in the traceroute echo messages.
 A more important difference is the contents of the data within ICMP payload.
 This 
\series bold
data has the copy of the original packet as such 
\series default
that was failed to be forwarded because of TTL expiration.
 Another difference is the Type field value which is 11 and the code is
 0 unlike ping packets (Type : 0,8).

On opening a Echo message and comparing with the ping packet used in ping
 command, we can find that there is no difference in the fields names i.e
 the structure of the packet.
 The only diffrence here is that TTL is set differently (from 1 to 17 in
 our case).
 These TTL variations can be seen from the wireshark capture.

Upto IP header, the ICMP error as well as the echo messages take the same
 format.
 However their payloads, which in turn contain the ICMP data messages, are
 entirely different.
 Both ICMP data messages have Type, Code fields as well as checksum.
 The 
\series bold
differences
\series default
 between the ICMP error message and the ICMP ping messages are:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

1) Echo packet has Identifier and a Sequence number field which is used
 by the ping program.
 These fields are not present in the ICMP error message.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

2) Echo packet has a small data field (usually 24 bytes).
 However ICMP error message has the 
\series bold
entire packet that was initially transmitted 
\series default
by the router (with an insufficient TTL) starting from the network layer
 header.
 This is the reason why it appears to have more fields because it encapsulates
 the original ping packet in its payload.
